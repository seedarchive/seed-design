<h3>The Condition of Societies in the 21st Century</h3><br/>

<p>The quality of life for growing numbers of people on the planet is
threatened by a set of systemic problems: climate change and other
environmental perils, industrial dependence on fossil fuels, pressures for
unrealistic levels of economic growth, inequitable distribution of wealth
and income, excesses and hidden costs of consumerism, and the undue
influence of global corporations over working conditions, social wellbeing,
and governing institutions. Many democracies have trouble addressing these
issues, in part because political parties have been captured by business
interests, and more generally, because professional politicians have lost
touch with many younger citizens who prefer direct action to tired ideas
and empty promises. Authoritarian regimes and failed states are even less
able to engage with economic and environmental disruptions.</p>

<p>If the democracies are to lead the way in finding new models for human
wellbeing within environmental limits, nothing short of a renewal of
politics is required. Political systems once regarded as mechanisms for
solving problems are now widely regarded as part of the problem. Many
governments face legitimacy crises for failing to deliver a good life to
citizens who witness the soaring compensation of executives, the giveaway
of public assets to private interests, and the adoption of austerity
regimes that dump ordinary people into poor jobs, low mobility and
poverty. Due to the mismanagement of economic and political affairs by
national and world elites, most countries face economic stagnation and
political turbulence. Growing economic inequality produces poor health and
precarious life prospects for majorities in the global south and for
increasing numbers in the north. Billions of people in the global south
face food and water shortages, among other legacies of corruption and
climate change that contribute to failed states, wars, and migration.</p>

<p>These problems are likely to grow worse, as economic indicators point to
slow growth and recession as realistic scenarios for the long term. The
singular pursuit of profits by investors and corporations has produced
economies burdened by speculation, bad bank debt, and declining consumer
demand as workers are displaced by technology and low paying
jobs. Inequality has grown dramatically in most OECD nations since the
crash of 2008, partly as a result of government stimulus monies that flowed
upward into speculation rather than socially productive investment. Even
when government stimulus plans overcome these problems, recoveries can be
quickly dragged down by the costs of extracting depleted natural resources
when demand picks up.</p>

<p>It is time to challenge the prevailing magical thinking that deregulated
markets somehow possess intelligence, create the best outcomes, and make
people free. Similarly dubious assumptions about the virtues of GDP growth,
no matter the form or the distribution, continue to be recited by
economists, media pundits, and leading politicians. Many social democratic
and labour parties have been hollowed out by the lure of neoliberalism,
abandoning their legacy of forging better social contracts between business
and labour. As a result, increasing numbers of people now live precarious
lives with little hope that politicians will disenthrall themselves from
business influence and flawed market models in order to develop a politics
that puts people first. </p>

<p>Adding to these problems, consumerism has become the most widely shared
cultural scheme on the planet, crossing boundaries of ideology, religion,
race, gender, and class. Advertising exhorts people to buy things they do
not need and often cannot afford. The advertised attractions of consumer
lifestyles distract attention from the unsustainable realities of a broken
system: consumer debt, emotional stress, poor labor conditions,
displacement of other social values, and continuing dependence on fossil
fuels for producing and distributing goods that are designed to go out of
fashion.</p>

<p>Rather than allow these chaotic systems to produce greater dysfunction,
the present moment can become an opportunity for creative solutions. It is
time to think about what kinds of economic production are most desirable,
and how the outputs should be distributed. Economic growth based on
speculation must be replaced by investments that produce greater social
wellbeing. A more equitable economic system must also include ways of
addressing resource depletion and declining environmental
quality. Scientists report that the Earth is currently undergoing a sixth
great extinction of species. The other five were triggered by natural
events. This one is created by an economic system that has exceeded the
limits of a finite planet. Yet many politicians and economists continue to
promise unrealistic levels of growth with little regard for developing
economic policies that better serve people and planet.</p>

<p>The current dystopian vision -- built from speculative markets, growth at
any cost, better representation for the rich, and equating the interests of
corporations with the wellbeing of people -- is surely not the best that
contemporary civilization can offer. Creating social, cultural and economic
systems that put people, communities, and the planet first, requires
reimagining the simple elements of the good life. What helps people
prosper? The basic elements of prosperity include food, shelter, health,
education, security, leisure, participation, creative expression, and
freedom from violence and oppression, among others. The challenge is to
find new political and economic models that focus on such basic human
values, and to organize politics to deliver these results.</p>

<P>It is time to bridge these three critically related areas of democracy,
economics, and environmental policy with a broad agenda for change that
combines input from academics, activists, civil society organizations,
parties, and concerned citizens. As long as the politicians and business
elites who dominate public discussion continue to preside over a system
that only works for the few, the pressing problems of people and planet
cannot be addressed, and they will become worse.</p>
     
<h3>What Is To Be Done?</h3><br/>

<p>Many democracies have lost their capacity to address environmental,
economic, and social sustainability because wealthy individuals and
corporate interests exercise undue political power, limiting the choices of
ordinary citizens. If a manageable transition is to occur, political
movements and emerging parties must combine resistance with positive
advocacy of broad political, economic, and environmental agendas. The
desired result is a new social contract that better balances owners and
workers, citizens and governments, and consumers and the planet. Business
must play a central role in this transition, recognizing that long-term
stability based on shared prosperity is of greater value than pursuing
short-term profits in turbulent markets.</p>

<p>Throughout history there have been important ideas about how to create
more equitable and prosperous societies. Indeed, many forms of capitalism
have existed since Adam Smith wrote of the virtues of markets operating in
societies that possessed enough empathy, altruism and justice to use them
wisely. Smith was a moral philosopher, who would surely object to the
current amoral system that has unleashed cruel markets and unfeeling
corporations whose market success is often manipulated by lobbying and
business influence that result in government favors. Where is the empathy
in this system for workers who have been displaced by technology and cheap
international labor in pursuit of profits? Where is the freedom or justice
for those who fail in a game that is rigged in favor of the strongest
players with the best inside ties to power? What is the self-correcting
mechanism for markets driven to collapse by unregulated speculation,
resulting in public bailouts for reckless corporations and harsh doses of
austerity for the rest?</p>

<p>If the economy does not work well for most people, and is threatening
the life support systems of the planet, then it seems time to rethink how
it can work better. There is no shortage of good ideas. Indeed, a large
collection of promising thought emerged during the 1960s and 1970s
addressing such issues as: the poisoning of the planet (Rachel Carson), the
need to design systems for a finite planet (Kenneth Boulding), the conflict
between unmanaged growth and the environment (The Club of Rome Limits to
Growth report), and basic principles of sustainable economics necessary to
live within these realities (Herman Daly, and more recently, Tim
Jackson).</p>

<p>There are also large literatures showing that conventional measures of
economic prosperity such as GDP do not necessarily correlate with good
human outcomes. GDP growth produced greater prosperity for many nations in
the mid 20th Century when guided by different political and social
values. However, the times and conditions have changed. Current
contradictions of the economy versus the environment and inequality versus
average life quality are no longer possible to ignore. The levels of growth
experienced in the mid 20th century appear never to have occurred before,
and seem unlikely to occur again (Piketty). Future economic policies must
be evaluated not in terms of indiscriminate growth, but according to who
benefits from more people-oriented public and private investment. Economic
policies should be calculated according to social and environmental
outcomes: health, education, nutrition, shelter, leisure time, work that
puts people above the poverty line, opportunities for people to develop
their potential, and restoration of thriving natural environments. What is
a path toward these outcomes?</p>
    
<h3>Solutions for Economy, Environment, and Democracy (SEED)</h3><br/>

<p>Several decades of large-scale protests against this world economic and
environmental order suggest that many people understand various aspects of
these problems and seek to do something about them. The politics of
resistance must be expanded into a politics of positive action. This is a
proposal for developing idea networks that engage citizens, activists,
business interests, scholars, and politicians in rethinking their visions
of prosperity. Many citizens grasp the complexity of the problems facing
civilization, and understand the many arenas -- local, national,
transnational, north and south -- in which issues must be addressed. The
challenge is to develop more holistic thinking that feeds more flexible
political organizations, such as hybrid movement-parties that aim to make
change locally while linking their efforts nationally and globally.</p>

<p>Finding these pathways to sustainable societies for people in different
circumstances depends on creative ideas generated by diverse knowledge
communities. Those ideas must be communicated in compelling ways using
narratives and memes that travel across social, cultural, and political
boundaries. Tired ideologies and brands of thought must be opened to fresh
examination in the interests of bridging differences and expanding popular
participation in inclusive movements and democratic processes. New
technology development is required for engaging geographically dispersed
and politically diverse people in this process. Smart technology and social
media networks can help people create, curate and share creative thought
and action on a variety of issues. These idea networks must include
practitioners who offer critical experience and feedback about political
and economic experiments that work. It is time to move beyond Twitter
revolutions that produce massive expressions of anger and hope, and develop
new technology platforms that reflect political models that address
interrelated issues and scale across different geographical and cultural
boundaries.</p>

<p>The goal of the SEED project is to bring together scholars, NGO
practitioners, activists, and party leaders to reinvent a politics for the
current era in which many citizens have grown increasingly skeptical about
parties, elections and governments. Membership and voting support for
traditional center-left and center-right parties has been in decline. Far
right parties are on the rise nearly everywhere in the democracies,
attracting voters who respond to reactionary nationalist and racial
discourses. At the same time, progressive movements and parties are
experimenting with the logic of connective action that uses technology to
flatten hierarchies and engage citizens in dialogue. However, these large
action networks generally emerge as technology equipped crowds that occupy
public spaces and tend to be chaotic and short lived. What technologies
would help such networks of concerned citizens stabilize and interface
better with democratic institutions?</p>

<p>There is a key element is currently missing from this political picture: a widely accessible information/action network for generating and sharing ideas across diverse and geographically dispersed publics. While there are many intellectual spaces filled with good ideas, they do not add up. The SEED network should be more than a website and email list; it should use a combination of in-person meetings to foster personal connections, along with intelligent open source, noncommercial, secure technology to put people with good ideas together in an environment that helps them bridge differences, distill thinking, and develop focused practices. This network must have the capacity to assess successes and failures, and develop organizational models that interface effectively with democratic institutions.</p>

<h3>What Can We Learn from the Rise of Neoliberalism?</h3><br/>

<p>The rise of neoliberalism in the 1970s and 1980s shows why such an idea
network is important. The utopian vision of deregulating markets,
privatizing public life, and celebrating individual freedom as a promised
outcome passed through a long lineage from Friedrich Hayek, Ayn Rand,
Milton Friedman, dozens of Nobel Laureates, and into the political
repertoires of Augusto Pinochet, Margaret Thatcher, Ronald Reagan, and Deng
Xiaoping, and quickly swept world governments by the end of the 20th
Century. It was not the sheer persuasive force of those simple ideas that
carried them forward. A neoliberal idea network emanated from the
impressive roster of members and guests at meetings of the Mont Pelerin
Society founded by Hayek after the end of World War II. Ideas generated
from this intellectual core were spread through a global network of think
tanks funded by industrialists, foundations, and corporations. When a great
crisis hit the world economy in the 1970s, neoliberalism was positioned to
take advantage of the opportunity, even though there was no shortage of
better ideas.</p>

<p>During the same period in which neoliberal thinking emerged as a global
force, a far more popular global social movement had mobilized around
visions of preserving the environment and building an economy that better
served people and planet. Despite having superior numbers, and more
pragmatic visions, this movement was poorly positioned to plant its ideas
with business and government. Indeed, the greatest moment of early success
for the environmental movement also illustrates the failure of its
politics. In 1987 the United Nations issued the Brundtland Commission
report outlining Sustainable Development Goals. Despite nearly three
decades of continuing environmental decay and little economic progress in
the global south, the UN renewed the sustainable development goals in
2015. The idea of sustainable development continues to fill political and
media spheres with the attractive fantasy that environmental sustainability
is compatible with neoliberal growth policies. The compromised rhetoric of
sustainable development, and more recent buzz terms such as resilience and
green growth, are layered over a foundation of neoliberal economic
policies, mixed with Keynesian bailouts. A new vision must be developed if
the current crisis is not to end in a collapse that opens opportunities for
the continued rise of nationalist movements and parties. A similar scenario
produced the disasters of war, genocide, and totalitarianism that haunted
much of the early 20th Century. </p>

<p>A global SEED network will almost certainly lack the resources and inside connections that enabled think tanks and politicians to push neoliberalism into the lives of nearly everyone on the planet. However, there are opportunities in this historic moment if broad thinking meets smart political organization. Indeed, there are signs of progressive stirrings among voters in Europe and North America. The question is whether compelling ideas can bridge the critical areas of economy, environment and democracy, and offer inclusive participatory opportunities for people who are currently divided by tired ideology, geography, and dysfunctional politics. </p>

<h3>A Proposal for Developing the SEED Network</h3><br/>

<p>We want to develop the SEED network in two ways: first, by building an
online platform that connects our participants and facilitates sharing and
assessing ideas and action experiments operating in local, national and
international arenas; and second, by organizing a set of in-person
workshops and other meetings of participants. The online platform should be
constructed using open source and expandable technology, and should help
support democratic deliberation and distribute creative visions that engage
individuals, movements, civil society organizations, and parties. This core
platform must make it simple and inviting to develop collaborative ideas,
identify and bridge topics, build agendas, and foster the organizational
capacity to put those ideas into practice. The development of this
idea/action network will evolve in five stages of roughly one year
each. Assessment and learning at each stage may, of course, change the
definition and timing of later stages.</p> 

<p><b>Phase 1:</b> Develop an initial SEED network using a combination of
workshops and other in-person meetings, and a simplified initial version of
the platform using off-the-shelf open-source software. The initial set of
contributors will come from academic, business, and political sectors, and
will grow as members share content through their social networks using
affordances embedded in the platform. </p>

<p>Outcomes: 1) workshops and other meetings of participants in the SEED
network, 2) development of a simple initial version of SEED platform, 3)
publication of working papers that summarize emerging elements of the SEED
agenda, and 4) begin introducing proposals from the network into broader
intellectual and policy circles.</p> 

<p><b>Phase 2:</b> Develop a custom smart technology platform to support the
project, using a participatory process involving the current members of the
SEED network. The envisioned platform will enable semi-automated tagging
and curating of content, along with prompts for people to engage with the
contributions of others in ways that bridge topics and highlight
differences. Bridged information and popular resolutions of differences
will rise to become the most featured and shared content.</p>

<p>Outcomes: 1) development of the custom SEED platform, 2) publication of
additional working papers, and 3) continued introduction of proposals from
the network into broader intellectual and policy circles.</p>

<p><b>Phase 3:</b> Expand the network to include more practitioners from
parties, NGOs, movements, and other civil society organizations, with
emphasis on expanding membership in the global south. These practitioners
will contribute to the idea agenda, and offer pragmatic input about
obstacles and opportunities for implementing elements of the agenda. These
members will help diffuse the agenda through their organizational networks,
highlighting ways in which issues may be bridged and differences
resolved. </p> <p>Outcomes: 1) expanded membership in the SEED community,
2) additional development of smart platform functions to facilitate
exchanges and curate areas of convergence and disagreement, 3) publication
of practitioner reports and case studies that offer models for others to
adapt. </p>

<p><b>Phase 4:</b> The platform becomes an organizing hub for a set of
chartering principles for a sustainable, equitable prosperity within
environmental limits. The aim is to move these principles into political
arenas at all levels from local to global. </p>

<p>Outcomes: 1) the platform becomes open to broader publics governed by
established norms for participation similar to Wikipedia, 2) expanded
technology affordances enable people to trace the flow of ideas as they
enter real political settings such as protests, media reports, policy
initiatives, and elections, 3) development of a user archive of action
models based on SEED ideas.</p>

<p><b>Phase 5:</b> Assessment of successes and failures, and promotion of
models that work. Evaluations of various sorts include case studies, media
content tracking, and trends in movements and elections to provide
knowledge about which ideas travel, how they become established in arenas
of practice, and what standards of success make sense. </p>

<p>Outcomes: 1) research on diffusion of the SEED agenda by political
parties, movements, and media networks that reach broader publics, 2)
recognition by prominent leaders in different sectors of economics,
environment, politics, faith communities, business, and popular culture, 3)
translation of effective ideas and models for action into diverse social,
cultural and political settings. </p>

<p>The aim is to find pathways for concerned citizens in different nations
to find common ideas and develop modes of participation that are more
effective. Political parties and citizen movements must work better
together to refresh political agendas and bring new thinking into
governments. </p>

<hr>

<p>What will motivate participation in this network? The network will not
just consist of isolated individuals. It will grow through a constellation
of hubs with different topical expertise. These hubs will initially come
mainly from universities and NGOs housing researchers already engaged with
ideas related to the larger network goals. Participation in the SEED
network will increase exposure and sharing of ideas to help people find
larger communities of interest than may currently exist in
compartmentalized topic areas. The opportunity to share ongoing work and
achieve broader distribution should motivate participation. Opportunities
for collaborative work will be created. As the network expands to reach
more practitioners and citizens (NGOs, parties, movements, and general
publics), multi-directional sharing of ideas and models for practice will
offer the incentives of peer production communities to build worlds in
common that isolated nodes cannot achieve alone.</p>
